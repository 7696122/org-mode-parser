This node is used to stress the parsing algorithm with a very complex node
to validate. This node has plenty of stuff inside and will likely stress the entire
parsing procedure as well.
It has also a 'clock' entry. The clock entry is used for measuting time taken dealing with this entry
and could also be 'truncated' like in the section below
* Section 7 is like section 6 but only with a starting CLOCK
  CLOCK: [2011-10-04 Tue 16:41]
Text expected for Section 7
* DONE Section 8 with schedule, deadline and closed
DEADLINE: <2011-11-30 Wed> SCHEDULED: <2011-11-01 Tue> CLOSED: <2011-11-29>
