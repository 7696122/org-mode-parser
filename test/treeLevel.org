* Level one :data:1:
This file is used for some tree-nesting test and ALSO for performance testing.
For this reason, the performance testing part has a very complex node on its hown

This node is used to stress the parsing algorithm with a very complex node
to deal with. This node has plenty of stuff inside and will likely stress the entire
parsing procedure as well.
It has:
 + some properties 
 + a CLOCK entry used for measuting time taken dealing with this entry
 + a bullet list (you are reading it)

I am a complex subtree with a lot of stuff inside
I have a table
| Nice 3 Column | table | is here |
|---------------+-------+---------|
|               |       |         |
I have a bunch of tags and a long list of properties.
For children pleasure, I spot also a long list of #+ special org commands...
